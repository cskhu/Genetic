generate initial state
initialize temperature
while termination condition is not met do
     evaluate energy of state
     generate a new state in the neighborhood of
       current state
     evaluate energy of new state
     probabilistically decide to accept the new
       state based on energy, new energy and
       temperature
     cool down the temperature
